# Web VR with Three.js

This is a basic example of working with VR on the web using Three.js.

## Setup

You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. 

Then type the following in a terminal:

	npm install

## To Run

	npm run start

Then open [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) in a WebXR capable browser. If you are using Chrome or Firefox on a desktop you will first need to install a WebXR emulator ([for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webxr-api-emulator/mjddjgeghkdijejnciaefnkjmkafnnje?hl=en), [for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/webxr-api-emulator/)). Bring up the developer tools, select the WebXR tab and make sure a VR headset is selected in the drop-down on the left.
